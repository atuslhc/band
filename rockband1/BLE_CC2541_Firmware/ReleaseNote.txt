2017/02/08 V00.01
The rockband1 BLE CC2541 release versoin 00.01
1. BLE_CC2541_V00.01.hex
2. Create from Ti SensorTag and collect related files into the same directory and allocate these files as previous CC2540 directory
3. Merege serialinterface.c, serialinterface.h, npi.c and npi.h from Ti BLE_Bridege sample code
4. Change complier options: xPOWER_SAVING, HAL_UART=TRUE, HAL_UART_DMA=1, xHAL_UART_ISR=0, NPI_UART_PORT=HAL_UART_PORT_0, NPI_UART_FC=FALSE
5. Create CC2541DK-Sensor-Binary configuration for application code
6. Fix MCU get device information problem, add 3 packets on power on
   a) device init
      (1) BLE module state: bootloader or application
   b) start device in osal process event 
     (2) device information (MAC address)
     (3) BLE state: idle, advertising, connected
7. Bootloader disable
8. Power saveing disable for UART not workable
9. Use SmartRF Flash Programmer software and CC Debugger to download

2017/02/17 V00.02
The rockband1 BLE CC2541 release versoin 00.02
1. BLE_CC2541_V00.02.hex
2. Add Battery Service Profile
3. Remove temperature, barometer, and humidity functions
4. Change advertising data (PC tool could scan)

2017/03/06 V00.03
The rockband1 BLE CC2541 release version 00.03
1. BLE_CC2541_V00.03.hex
2. Enable compiler option POWER_SAVING
3. Change compiler option xHAL_UART_ISR=0 to HAL_UART_ISR=0
   (This change will not change anything. These two options are the same. Just more specific and not put in head file.)
4. Remove RTS and CTS related code of UART
5. Change RX to IO interrupt when enter sleep and back to RX function when exit from sleep
6. Remove LED setting, Key handling and Simple Key profile
7. The number of zero padding should be over 10, MCU code version should equal or higher than V00.15
